# Computational-and-Numerical-Methos
This repository contains lab work of the course Computational and Numerical Methods which was offered in 5th semester of B Tech ICT in minor computational science engineering at DAIICT.

Set 1 to 18 shows the lab session during the course. The assignment work, supporting matlab functions, results, graphs are available in each folder. All questions are placed in the pdf called "labwork_2019".pdf. 

Matlab was the primary language and software to simulate the assignment. Since numerical approximation requires accurecy, matlab was used to handle the small input scale. 

Assignment contains four different part which are available in Assignment Folder. The question for this is present itselt in the Repo front page as "assign_2019.pdf"
