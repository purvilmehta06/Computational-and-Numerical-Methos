# Computational-and-Numerical-Methos
This repository contains lab work of the course Computational and Numerical Methods which was offered in 5th semester of B Tech ICT in minor computational science engineering at DAIICT.

Set 1 to 18 shows the lab session during the course. The assignment work, supporting matlab functions, results, graphs are available in each folder. All questions are placed in the pdf called lab-work.pdf. 

Matlab was the primary language and software to simulate the assignment. Since numerical approximation requires accurecy, matlab was used to handle small input scale.
